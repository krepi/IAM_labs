# IAM Study Journal: Concepts & Keywords

This study journal is a dedicated log for tracking my professional pivot from AML to IAM. Its primary purpose is to capture, explain, and reinforce technical nomenclature and foundational concepts encountered during my hands-on labs.

### [2026-03-29] Foundations: Python & Azure Authentication

1. **Python Virtual Environment (venv)**
   - **Definition:** A isolated directory containing a specific Python installation and a set of additional packages.
   - **Why it matters:** Prevents version conflicts between different projects and ensures a clean, reproducible environment for security tools.
   - **AML Analogy:** Like a "Clean Room" or a dedicated sandbox for a specific investigation where you don't want to mix evidence from other cases.

2. **pip (Python Package Index)**
   - **Definition:** The standard package manager for Python, used to install and manage software packages (libraries).
   - **Why it matters:** Essential for installing core IAM libraries like `msal` or `azure-identity`.
   - **AML Analogy:** Like a "Certified Tool Inventory" – you only use approved, specific versions of tools for your compliance audit.

3. **Azure CLI (az login)**
   - **Definition:** A set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources via the terminal.
   - **Why it matters:** The primary way to verify your identity to Azure from your local machine before running scripts.
   - **AML Analogy:** Your "KYC (Know Your Customer)" process for the cloud. The login token is your "Authorized Personnel" badge.

4. **MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library)**
   - **Definition:** A library that enables developers to acquire security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access secured web APIs.
   - **Why it matters:** The "engine" that handles tokens, sessions, and multi-factor authentication in your Python scripts.
   - **AML Analogy:** The "Token Dispenser" at a secure vault that issues a temporary pass after verifying your credentials.

5. **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)**
   - **Definition:** A cloud-based identity and access management service that helps your employees sign in and access resources.
   - **Why it matters:** It is the central database where you define roles (RBAC), users, and access policies.
   - **AML Analogy:** The "Master Registry" of all accounts and transaction limits within a financial institution.
